- :telescope: I am a PhD student in AI, but that's not all I have. I also have a serious case of wanderlust, an unquenchable thirst for adventure and a love for all things mindfulness and healthy living.
I'm basically a walking contradiction, I can discuss the intricacies of machine learning algorithms one minute and then talk about the best street food in Bangkok the next. I'm like a tech-savvy hippie, or a Zen-seeking robot, take your pick.
- ðŸ¤–: I am currently developing a computational model of creative problem-solving in deep reinforcement learning agents, specifically the AIGenC model. My primary focus is understanding how representation learning can enable artificial agents to learn, use, and generate transferable representations, how this can advance towards Artificial General Intelligence and improve out-of-distribution generalization. At the core of my research stands the concept space, a hierarchical graph structure containing different levels and types of representations.
